Change winning condition to be more robust:
	verifyHeap();

Currently the game requires the heap to be
breadth-first filled or else the winning condition
is buggy and can be abused for an early, but not
true win. 

Consider changing the GUI to make the navigation
to lower levels more smooth; currently difficult
to get adjusted to whenever the scope shifts.

Change code to be more efficient and cleaner.
